But strange events started happening, and was posing too much of a risk to the companies that hired people there. The local industries pulled out, leaving a highly modernized town that is steadily losing people, and is a shadow of its former self. They still have some modern comforts: policing, central heat and air, the Internet managed to make it out to them, but there\u2019s no opportunity there. The whole area is bleak, there\u2019s very little skilled labor to be had.\n\nI want some elements that I can sprinkle in for spice, some things that would telegraph to people that this place is crumbling and neglected but still trying to hold on. Most apartments are only half-populated, everyone is bitter to outsiders, but I need more that reflects the overall atmosphere of the city.",

        "content": "So, I\u2019m kinda stuck at a certain point in a chapter where my character Elizabeth is being questioned by an old man named Albin where she got so much money from. Some background: \n\nElizabeth technically fakes her death by >!killing herself!< but her magic, which is stealing souls, lets her use the stolen souls and gives her a second chance at life but she now has a different appearance. Anyway, her friend Alexander gives her a bag of money (basically just a bunch of gold and silver coins.) which is enough for her to live easily for a year. By the way, she wakes up in the forest after getting revived. She also had a ton of scars on her old body and in a manic episode of hers, she tore off a lot of her dress to make sure she had no scars. After spending a night in the forest, she makes it out, senses the old man, his mule, and the cart he\u2019s carrying. Blah blah, Albin decides to help her because she\u2019s seems the same age as his granddaughter. \n\nReason why Elizabeth faked her death: Because she was experimented and tortured by her father, and got a lot of her magic stolen, or rather was now being forcefully shared and the only way to stop it was if she were to die. So she did it with no hesitation. \n\nBack to background: Albin asks why she was in the forest in the first place. Elizabeth gets nervous and says she ran away from home. Technically the truth, but she believes she\u2019s lying. Albin just looks at her and sees tears, doesn\u2019t question it further. Albin is still hesitant, even says he can\u2019t trust her because bandits send bait like her to lure old men like him often, but Elizabeth assures him she\u2019s not. \n\nCut to where I\u2019m at: Albin and Elizabeth are now in a village that\u2019s close to Albin\u2019s village. Albin told her she needs a new a dress as her current on is too inappropriate and it even has blood on it. (She snapped her leg in half when she ran away in the middle of the night, but that\u2019s not important.) Albin tells her he\u2019ll pay because he assumes she has no money, Elizabeth goes inside the tailors shop, buys 10 dresses, wakes up Albin, surprises him with her new dress and Albin is in shock of how she bought all that and sees what\u2019s inside the bag of coins she has. \n\nNow, important details: Elizabeth told Albin she got the money from a friend. Just that. Even she doesn\u2019t know where Alexander, the friend, got the money from and she can\u2019t tell Albin of his occupation. Why? Because someone who knows Albin is someone who also knew Elizabeth before she faked her death. If Elizabeth tells Albin that Alexander is a foot soldier in training, and he just gave her some of his salary, Albin could go to Joseph(the man Albin knows) and ask him about it. By the way, Joseph trained Alexander when he was a boy and a young teen. He even knows everything about how the kingdom\u2019s military works, so any detail about Alexander would make Joseph think of him. And Joseph already saw Elizabeth in this village, but her new appearance saved her. So, Elizabeth is on edge. Right now I just made her by time by saying she could explain everything while they\u2019re on the way to Albin\u2019s village. I don\u2019t know what to do after that because the excuses have to be amazing, and I\u2019m having a hard time thinking.",

    "title": "Discussion: The Paradox of the \"Info Dump\"",
    "content": "The \"info dump\" is often scorned as the death knell of good storytelling. Conventional wisdom tells us it will suffocate a story: stalling the plot with long, bloated passages and overwhelming the reader with unnecessary detail.\n\nYet, in the hands of a skilled writer, an info-dump can be a thing of beauty: a moment of indulgent world-building or cerebral delight that enriches the narrative rather than derailing it.\n\nTake Moby-Dick, where Melville spends entire chapters dissecting the minutiae of whaling (from the anatomy of a sperm whale\u2019s head to the precise mechanics of rendering blubber into oil). It ought to feel excruciating, yet it\u2019s intoxicating; because Melville\u2019s voice is so alive with curiosity and obsession that we get drawn into his spiral.\n\nThese digressions aren\u2019t just trivia; they build atmosphere, deepen theme, and immerse us so completely in the whaling world that by the time Ahab faces the white whale, every historical, philosophical, and biological detail feels like part of the harrowing weight bearing down on him.\n\nBut the true magic of an info-dump isn\u2019t just in its prose (it\u2019s in its payoff). Take Dune, where Herbert frontloads the novel with dense political, ecological, and theological exposition about Arrakis, the spice melange, and the Fremen way of life. It could have been dry, but when Paul Atreides is thrust into the desert, every detail we absorbed suddenly matters. We understand why stillsuits work, why the Fremen fight the way they do, why the worms are sacred. Without that avalanche of context, Paul's transformation into Muad\u2019Dib wouldn\u2019t feel earned.\n\nSometimes, an info-dump is just a joy to read. Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett built their careers on them, filling The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy and Discworld with ridiculous tangents that have no direct bearing on plot (yet they are the soul of their books), the reason people return to them again and again.\n\nIMO cinema\u2019s influence on writing guidance has villainized the info dump, favoring economic storytelling (with mass appeal) over the sheer pleasure of slow exploration. Don\u2019t mistake a reader\u2019s unwillingness to engage with your story's lore as a failure of your writing. If an info dump is well-crafted (either it pays off or it\u2019s simply fun) then it deserves its place.\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: A well-crafted info-dump isn\u2019t a storytelling flaw. It can be immersive; provided it either pays off later or it is fun to read.",

Suicide Squad opens with the info dump and it feels endless as they just go through every single file of the team. Guardians you had gotten used to the characters so when they get arrested, the exposition dump is more natural as they\u2019re being read their danger level for the prison.\n\nSo you\u2019re right.

The King's army had been repurposed to quarrying stone after the War of the Fog ended.  They hauled the stones on their shields like sleds.\n\nAnd I just prefer this better:\n\nAdrian walked down the hall.  His boots clicking against the ancient stone slabs, echoing off the the shields hanging from walls.  The shields were mangled things, their shine rubbed away by the earth.  When he reached the audience room, the tapestry behind the throne caught his eye like it always did, soldiers dragging boulders on their shields.  It was disgraceful, an affront to the honor of warriors.\n\nSomething like that, I mean obviously not that but I just woke up and I'm on mobile.",

The stones were not quarried by masons; but by warriors, lashed like beasts of burden. When the War of the Fog ended, the King\u2019s army did not return home. They were harnessed, their swords smelted, and their banners burned. They were forced to drag rocks on their own shields, grinding the sigils of their families down to faded obscurity. The halls still echoed with the ragged breath of men who once bled for their king, worked to death while hauling his ass into a throne.\"\n\nAt least for me personally, the problem with my example versus your example is that if I'm \"telling\" rather than \"showing\", I run a greater risk of either devolving into stating facts or escalating into purple prose.\n\nIn any case, I think the passage is so short that it's unlikely an aspiring writer would worry that they'd created an info dump.",

We still mess it up, of course, but when we do, it\u2019s usually more obvious.\n\nIncorporating inner monologues or inner thoughts (well at-home in 1st-person narration), is a great way of working through direct exposition in a wah that feels engaging. But inner monologues in true 3rd-person narration is stupidly tricky. Right now, I\u2019m experimenting with a project that uses third-person omniscient narration with the inner monologues of multiple characters, all running simultaneously (like dialogue). It\u2019s an absolute nightmare to manage with clarity and without sounding either redundant or frantic; totally inconvenient, hardly worth the trouble. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\n\nBut as a creative exercise? It\u2019s ridiculously fun. And when it works the avant-garde result, dependent on a simple vocabulary, becomes elevated.",

You are sometimes zoomed out to what is basically a 'storyteller' perspective, then you slide into the mind of a particular character, then leave it and slide into somebody else. This is not a flaw, it's a feature!

Just like forced exposition in movies, it's often just given to a character to say to another character for the express purpose of getting the audience caught up on the plot. \n\nIn the hands of skilled storytellers you can totally deliver information in a compelling way. In fact there's an entire genre of books that specialize in this: nonfiction!\n\nCase in point: both Dune's Herbert and Moby Dick's Melville started their writing careers as nonfiction writers (Herbert was a journalist and Melville wrote biographical accounts of his sea travels)\n\nIt's no wonder they were able to inform and entertain all at once. they'd both had a fair bit of practice. \n\nI'd encourage any fiction readers/writers who rarely cross over into the nonfiction world to give some literary/creative nonfiction a chance some time, it'll add tools to your storytelling tool kits.",

People warn against info dumps because new authors, especially in scifi and fantasy, often fall into the trap of info dumping about the amazing worldbuilding they've done the moment they begin their book, and it sounds more like an encyclopedia than an actual story. Just like \"show, don't tell.\" That advice is INFAMOUS on this sub, but that doesn't make it inherently bad. Learning when to apply these guidelines and when not to comes with practice. The guidelines themselves simply work to help newer authors look at writing from different angles and understand how to improve their own.

But it's always there.\n\nThe question is how to get this information to your reader in an engaging way. Blocks of text that interrupt the flow of the story are generally boring. Characters discovering small nuggets of information as a natural part of their progression of the story can be very intriguing.

First, people write them outside of the voice of the rest of the story, so they feel like dry textbook excerpts rather than the narrator/character explaining *why* this information is so important to them. It's boring to read because it feels like we're leaving the story momentarily to get the information. Second, the information isn't actually relevant to the story. It builds the world, but it adds nothing to the characters we're hearing about. I got this sensation while reading *Game of Thrones* a lot, just paragraph after paragraph of information about who's the head of X house, what their flag looks like, who their bannermen are, and it was just so damned boring because it never paid off, it just felt like padding to show off that he knew so much about the world. \n\nPeople crave information in stories, they just also want to be entertained by it.",

    "content": "A couple of days ago I wrote a post asking about how important a great hook is to a story. But none of the responses seemed to get at what I actually meant. And I was later informed by a user that what I was getting at was actually called a \"high concept\" premise. And so I figured I'd make this post and ask about what I was actually pondering: Basically, my goal is trad publishing, and more often than not, I've ideas for stories that lack a unique/high concept. It's just about a character, a person; their circumstance. And usually when I've idea for a high concept, it's attached to ideas for stories that I've no clue how to write; stories I don't even know if I can write. Not just technically, but emotionally. And so as of late, I've started to worry... if my goal is trad publishing, should I try and figure these hook-laden high concept ideas out despite the fact that I'm not sure I can even write them, or is this kind of mindset destructive? How important is a high concept for a great book?",

To Kill a Mockingbird has a great hook, in that it tackles social tensions and legal ramifications in the racist deep south from the point of view of a child. But it's not \"high concept\" because of how grounded the subject matter is.\n\nGatsby, Catcher in the Rye, and Pride and Prejudice are other VERY famous low concept novels. \n\nHigh concept really just means \"This story is different enough from our reality that I can quickly point to the unique elements as a point of interest.\" It's a helpful attribute for a book to have, since it gives it the chance to stand out and be memorable. But it's not a requirement and it's certainly not enough to hang your hat on. Whatever you want to get published, it still need to be good.",

And suddenly the ideas kept coming back. I was able to continue the story. It's now sitting at about 60% of what I imagine will be the  plot, and whenever I feel like I won't come up with something new today, I start going through and editing previous chapters. Still better than writing nothing at all.\n\nSometimes I even do this with chapters I am currently working on.

Yes I'm in highschool and these type of anime and animations are my source of entertainment. I have a draft but I feel like it is very vague can I request some help?\n\nThe \"Draft\" more like outline of the story I guess:\n\nItsuki, growing up in the peri-urban area of Osaka, he finds himself falling in love with Miyako, which the build up of their relationship  increases slowly, when it finally ends in an abrupt fall into the ground and then a slow cutoff from each other (Miyako believes Itsuki was unable to express his feelings for her leaving her in a limbo and for herself she moves on (ghosting him which he goes on a whole side quest to get closer where she explains the latter)). Then the slow healing process begins when the abrupt ghosting happens where Miyako cuts contact to Itsuki, he finds Tsubasa, she is a kind and sweet girl with a rocky past connected to people using her, her parents neglecting and her spiralling emotionally. She finds peace in Itsuki, he returns the feelings and they have their moment, a real healthy relationship but Itsuki can\u2019t stand the fact that Miyako hangs out with boys more than girls, he has a whole part where he confronts her and she explains the girls in her class see her as an outcast but she makes efforts and is slowly closer to the girls cutting off Itsuki\u2019s overthinking. After becoming official with Miyako, Itsuki starts reminiscing about his unrequited love with Miyako where he tracks her down to ask for closure, he feels he wants to be with her but clearly sees she is with someone else and is only entertaining his small talk. Soon he will loose Tsubasa after spiralling himself to \u201cattain\u201d Miyako\u2019s love, Tsubasa becomes suicidal but finds herself a new man Akugawa who really loves her unlike Itsuki\u2019s true self. Itsuki unable to make his love\u2019s ends meet he spirals into a dark, treacherous path\u2026\n\nPlease tell me what I have done well, and done bad, I want all the creative criticism",

What is the reason you expect the reader to want to read the next page, the next chapter, let alone recommend it to someone else when they've finished?\n\nFrom how you've described it, it sounds like a book about an unhealthy unlikeable person who hurts the people around him and inevitably fails to grow or change in any meaningful way. That's honestly kind of realistic, there are a lot of people like that, but why would I as a reader have any reason to want to see this story to its conclusion. If I'm reading for growth and there is no growth I'll be disappointed. If I'm reading for a happy ending and there isn't one I'll still be disappointed. Nothing about this premise makes me root for the protagonist, and even if you did get me to root for the protagonist, I'd be disappointed that they never actually achieve anything.\n\nOne of things things that's really important in the references you've given is that there is an entire other element of the main characters that make the reader root for them and a whole other narrative that makes the tragedy in their dating life an element of some bigger picture.\n\nRobin and Invincible are great examples. They are heroes. The audience wants them to succeed because they are heroes, and the struggles in their relationship make them feel more human and real. But your protagonist isn't a hero... He's just kind of a bad dude?",

Write one story. Figure out one small part of this larger thing (top of my head, the scene where he tries to reconnect with Miyako) - write that as a complete story. Make it GOOD.

If you are looking for ways to elevate this kind of story to make it more widely interesting, then (a) don't think of it as a romance, think of it as a tragic romance, and make sure you promise this to your readers up front, (b) don't rely on cliches or tropes drawn from anime, read a few romances and tragic romances and fill your subconscious with plenty of material for interesting and original ways of telling these kinds of stories and what kinds of things readers like, (c) make sure your characters all have believable motivations and have goals and interests beyond \"unrequited love,\", (d) realize the key to a good tragedy is for the audience to \\*want\\* the protagonist to succeed, and even have them make steps toward succeeding, but at the end they are unable to overcome some tragic flaw -- stories about characters that start off sad, stay sad the whole time, and end sad are depressing, not tragic.",

Get it out of your system, edit it, no matter how long or short it ends up being. It's *your story* first and foremost. You don't need to conform to any genre expectations if you're not writing it with the explicit aim of getting it published - and I would advise you don't, most authors out there write a couple of novels just for their own entertainment before they get anything published. Writing for a market is a worry for later. For now, the only thing that matters is that *you like writing it.*\n\nIf you get stuck on the writing process, there's plenty of things to find out there to guide you along. Novels tend to follow a structure more or less, use those to guide you whenever you're wondering \"right, what next\". Make an outline, or don't, up to you.",

And I can't tell you how many people have told me that he doesn't write in third person omniscient.\n\nI believe that feedback is always good to consider as we are on a journey of self-improvement.\n\nSome of the feedback, however, is reflective of taste rather than quality. I think u/Content_Audience690 nailed it as far as, in general, there are times it is done poorly and it has impacted the audience. I think it has something to do with the fact that books are so accessible now and just about anyone can put one out, it's not like it used to be where a book at least couldn't be completely awful and get published. Readers are tired of investing themselves and getting disappointed. And I understand that.\n\nTo respond to your point, thought. I couldn't put a scene break in a battle if I wish to go back and forth from different points of view. It would take away from the experience.\n\nWhat I have learned from feedback, more than anything, is that that individual books are not for everyone. I have beta readers that love my POV swaps. They still provide constructive criticism on other areas. Or about the POV swap if it isn't sufficiently clear. But there are some readers that are simply not interested. And that's ok.\n\nThe biggest takeaway, though, was the idea that if metaphors and complex language get trimmed a bit, then they hit harder in key spots. That was pretty cool.",

Literally the beta reader who at points remembered my lore better than I did was questioning things about my magic system that I thought were pretty clear cut. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t if this was coming up. \n\nAnd it SUCKED to hear that. But instead of going \u201cI\u2019m right, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d I sat around and thought about what I could do better to make it clearer, while also being able to remove a lengthy preamble at the beginning about the magic. \n\nIf the feedback is something that only one person is pointing out, you can probably brush it off as an opinion. (Same beta reader somehow came to the conclusion that the villain was the MC\u2019s mother in disguise? Which no one else had ever even threw out as a joke theory.) This was feedback I could brush off, as it wasn\u2019t a recurring problem. \n\nYou\u2019re obviously young and new to your writing journey. There\u2019s a lot of learning that takes time. When I wrote my first book, I refused to take any criticism that I didn\u2019t like. However, that didn\u2019t make me a stronger writer. It held me back. \n\nBut as you are still in the middle of writing your book, I would honestly advise you to wait until you\u2019re done with the entire first draft before engaging outside feedback. Actually, write your draft. Put it away for a few weeks, if not a few months, to give yourself distance from the text. Do your first comb over after that, and THEN pass to beta readers for feedback. \n\nA lot of the issue is that when you are currently writing, you are too close to the material. You know what\u2019s going on in your head, but it doesn\u2019t always translate onto the page. When you give yourself that distance, you can come back and go \u201cwait, what did I mean here?\u201d\n\nRight now YOU think that your narrative flows well because you know everything that\u2019s going on. Your readers do not. It\u2019s your job to make sure they understand, and that\u2019s not a matter of taste, but a matter of craft.",

I include execution to that. It is possible to turn the simplest and most common idea into something interesting and exciting, when executed properly.\n\nFurthermore, specifically about cliches, everyone has a different view on it. Depending on culture, country or even person, certain acts are not cliches for one, while they are cliches for the other. While #A thinks of being betrayed by your best friend as a clich, #B doesn't. As a matter of fact, those circumstances exist in reality, and they are more common than one would think. And still, no one should call a real person's situation/agony a cliche.\n\nI would go as far as to say, that cliches in writing come to exist, because the quality of execution doesn't match the content in that possible paragraph where a cliche was added to - usally when it was added just for the sake of having it added (in a superficial way), without putting effort into elaborating its core.",

Shyness and making a fool of oneself on the first date is often considered as a cliche, although those circumstances exist in reality with consequences and honesty. Calling a situation overused and labeling it as a cliche, although it is so real with its consequences, roots in the way of execution. - And in this case, shyness on the *first* date isn't necessarily the trope, but just one scene/situation of many, within a romance novel.\n\nAnother example, from the world of Anime (Naruto), where the trigger of the main story is about #A being betrayed by #B. This was not really overused by that time, but since then, any other similar idea after that, was called a cliche by many, although the cores of those new stories were completely based on it, making it its own trope.\n\nAnd calling a supposedly cliche a trope in a book, can also mean, that the personal interest in it was so big, that the author put alot of effort into it, to lift its cliche level to the level of trope. That actually could be an example for a good execution, and won't negate neither my nor your idea either.\n\nThere is also no warrant, that a trope is immune of turning into a cliche, or that utilizing something overused not as a trope, will turn it into a cliche. In both cases, effort can be the key. A bad maintained trope can be a cliche, while a well executed overused non-trope scene can escape from being called a cliche.\n\nDefinitions of certain terms don't necessarily make what I said wrong in my previous comment. The human mind can be a contradiction at times. Oh and don't get me wrong, I didn't label your very first comment as wrong either. I just tried to give my input about how unreliable the word cliche can be sometimes, based on real life, cultures, personalities, countries, technical story execution etc. So, it would make sense, to look at the written work, after (at least enough of it) is finished, to see, whether the used content was turned into a cliche or not, based on the efforts in execution and the overall context. You won't know it without having written anything. Thus, avoiding cliches form start is like trying to fix a washing machine with a toolbox, before it is even broken.",

It might put off some people, but I like how it makes the writing much more fast-paced and to the point. The downside is that the book turns out to be pretty short (25k words), but I feel like I've told the story I wanted to tell. Should it make an effort to \"describe more things\" just to make it more lengthy?\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

You s*hould* pour long descriptions into the look of the town, the architecture used, the kinds of people on the streets. You *should* tell use what is engraved upon the sword or what is embroidered on the banners hanging over the king's throne. What you should *not* do is tell us why.\n\nI think right now where a lot of authors get caught up is this need to explain why everything is the way it is. A patient reader wants to be entertained and so long as the characters in the world act like this is perfectly natural the reader will not question things too much.\n\nAn example for instance would be to have a female character say, \"Both of my husbands recommended I try training under you. They say you're the finest duelist in the city.\"\n\nAnd instead of then saying in your prose something like 'Fakelandia was, after all, a matriarchy. Women would take two, three, sometimes five husbands. Rich women would often have a veritable platoon of grooms following them about.' you could just have the sword master go, \"They were not wrong, ma'am! Do you prefer the rapier and dagger, or the Warraceian skullblades?\"",

You are literally saying - here is the story of this world, and the story of this world IS the story I am telling. Which is legitimate, if you can make it interesting. Personally, I love a bit of well-told world history... but it needs to be that; it needs to be a story, a history, it needs to be more than just an exposition dump born of a writer's insecurity (like they're leaning over your shoulder and saying \"I need to give you some context here or you won't get it...\")\n\nThe best writing, I suppose, combines the two - explicit world-building to set the stage, while knowing that when the characters who live in that world are focused upon, they KNOW the world, so it should become implicit and drift into the background.",

The village was a comfortable mud-walled place surrounded by grasslands and scattered trees. But Doro realized even before he reached it that its people were gone. Slavers had been to it before him. With their guns and their greed, they had undone in a few hours the work of a thousand years. Those villagers they had not herded away, they had slaughtered. Doro found human bones, hair, bits of desiccated flesh missed by scavengers. He stood over a very small skeleton \u2014 the bones of a child \u2014 and wondered where the survivors had been taken. Which country or New World colony? How far would he have to travel to find the remnants of what had been a healthy, vigorous people?\n\nFinally, he stumbled away from the ruins bitterly angry, not knowing or caring where he went. It was a matter of pride with him that he protected his own. Not the individuals, perhaps, but the groups. They gave him their loyalty, their obedience, and he protected them.\n\nHe had failed.",

If you're daydreaming about dragons, you don't have to know the temperature of a sneeze. A writer writes about passion, not about spec analyses. We write about people. In fact, readers don't want to know *What happens.* They want to know *What happens to whom*. So concentrate about the whom, and\u2014as desired\u2014keep the backdrop and the rationale intensely intricate or insanely simple. *In a medieval land of exotic castles castles and daring knights, dragons filled the air.* Some readers may want more, but if your premise is exciting, promising, they'll read on. Fill in bits of visuals, or rituals, or nuance here and there as your story unfolds. Tease readers as your story progresses with sights and sounds and 'tudes and moods.\n\nYes, there's such a thing as *'within reason.'* A story can be too much or too little. We have to find that *Goldilocks Zone* of blending a dramatic, exciting plot line with character development and with reasonably specific realm-building and scene-setting\u2014but most of us find a style that nicely suits our abilities and our voice. I mean, George R.R. Martin can (and will) spend a dozen pages just describing a feast.  Conversely, Kurt Vonnegut might write a single line about the end of the world. They both sell books. And so it goes.\n\nSo find a style that you enjoy writing, and then stick with it. (It will evolve, of course, as you do.) But if you don't have fun writing it, you probably shouldn't write it. So have fun, first and foremost.\n\nP.S.: If you enjoy minimalism, hate the clutter, love dialogue and no-frills stage-directing, consider turning your story into a screenplay.",

So write it, and then keep writing, and then figure out why you hate it, and fix that stuff instead of deleting. \n\nThe process of becoming a better writer has four steps.\n\n1.) Read a lot. And when you read, read critically. Don't just passively absorb the story, pay attention to the way the author describes things, the way they move the plot forward and pace the story beats, and the way they develop the characters.\n\n2.) Write. It's not going to be good at first. Everyone starts out not great- it's a hobby that takes practice to get good at. The saying goes you can't edit a blank page; you need something there first.\n\n3.) Get feedback. A.) This feedback needs to be honest. This means don't give it to mom or your girlfriend or your close peer group. They'll tend to be nice, and you do NOT want nice. If it's hot garbage, you want to hear that so you can fix it. B.) The feedback also needs to be from people who know what they're talking about- other writers, English majors/teachers, etc. You want someone who knows how to identify the problems you have to be able to point them out to you, so you can move to the last step.\n\n4.) Take the feedback, and go fix it.\n\nIt's this four part process, repeated over and over and over again that will help hone you into a better writer.",

If I were to take up sculpting in marble, I'd be lucky, on my first try, to turn a block of stone into a pile of rubble without injuring myself.\n\nProse fiction is a little better since we already speak the language, so our early efforts will have some good stuff in them here and there, but it still takes a lot of practice.\n\nSome tips:\n\n1. Embrace your beginner's status. Most of your stories will read like they were written by a beginner, which they were. All is well. There's no such thing as not being good enough to be a beginner.\n\n2. Never delete anything. In fact, keep backups. At the start of every writing day, I save a new version of my current project with today's date as part of the file name. That way, I can back up if I make a wrong turn.\n\n3. For the last 150 years or so, it's been traditional to start with crime or adventure fiction because it's easier than other modes and even pretty bad stuff had a ready market. See [Lester Dent's 1939 article](https://www.fiction.plamondon.com/all-about-the-lester-dent-master-plot-formula-step-by-step-story-creation/) on writing crime stories. It's the shortest guide and has the best coverage of the mindset that I've come across.\n\nA couple of examples for you:\n\nLate in life, Isaac Asimov published his earliest works, I suppose to show new writers an example of a writer's progression over time. His early stories were terrible! But he got better pretty quickly. He made his first sale at eighteen and the first installment of his Foundation novels at twenty-one. It won't take you long to write better stories than his earliest ones.\n\nStephen King started writing when he was around your age. After a while he managed to sell a short story now and then, but he didn't become an \"overnight success\" until ten years later, with his novel *Carrie.*",

        "content": "Firstly READ MORE. Pay attention to what the writer is doing. Take mental notes when you like a particular technique.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nI think the quickest/easiest shortcuts to strong prose are:\n\n**1. VERBS** \\- use strong, specific verbs and avoid adverbs - 'He sprinted' instead of 'He ran quicky', 'The mouse scurried away' instead of 'The mouse ran away'. Also try to use active verbs instead of 'to be' verbs, e.g. 'Rice had been spilled all over the floor' instead of 'There was rice all over the floor'.\n\n>he was tall. He had brown hair\u201d\n\nThese are poor because they use 'to be' verbs ('was' and 'had') instead of action verbs. The sentences themselves are fine, but usually this kind of wording is dull. By using better verbs these could become:\n\n\"He towered over me. His flowing brown hair was practically touching the clouds!\"\n\nThis is similar to what people mean when they say 'show, don't tell'. Don't tell the reader a character was tired, show them yawning or rubbing their eyes.\n\n**2. VARIETY** \\- change sentence lengths and structures to create rhythm and avoid monotony. Short sentences are great for action, longer ones for introspection. Try rewording sentences with different words at the start instead of always defaulting to 'noun verb' all the time.\n\n**3. TRIM** \\- Cut excess words. 'The bank manager' is better than 'The manager of the bank'. Small words are often unnecessary, especially when there are many in a sentence. Try rewording more cleanly.  \n\\-----------------\n\nAs for resources, the Internet is full of them. Search for articles and videos about prose writing. Look up the various writing aid software available that can point out potential ways to improve. There are also books like [https://mybook.to/MEEtjd3](https://mybook.to/MEEtjd3) , which has lots of examples and exercises to practices with.",

Maybe self publishing is an option once I have enough disposable income, but otherwise I have little aspirations of actually getting published. \n\nNow, with that being said, even if you write mostly for yourself, the best way to improve is to let other people read your work. It sounds counterintuitive to the notion of \"writing for yourself\", I know, but a second, or even third perspective is invaluable to spotting mistakes that you are blind to. You don't have to take your readers' word for gospel, just pick and choose which you feel would make your writing better. \n\nYou mention feeling too mechanical with your prose, especially on descriptions and dialogue tags. I think the best way to address this other than having someone (preferably an experienced reader/writer) read your work is to read more. Generic advice, I know, but trying to imitate a style, especially if you're not planning to publish, isn't bad at all. If you want to make it more 'yours' still, then you can read whatever your favorite book is, then compare it with your previous writings and think up of ways to implement the elements of the book you love to your own writing. \n\nTldr; read more (in a critical way) and have someone else read your work.",

Put yourself in that world. Imagine what the setting looks like when you walk in, what the characters faces look like as they\u2019re speaking, the gestures that they do, imagine what sounds you would hear, what you would smell. Engage all five senses as you immerse yourself in the world. That\u2019s the main principle of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d.\n\nFor example, I have a scene where two characters enter a mostly abandoned apartment complex. The elevator is metal and rickety, and it screeches as it opens. The windows sag because they\u2019ve never been replaced. The paint on the outside is crumbled and peeling. There\u2019s a smell of water damage. Electricity from an exposed wire hisses and crackles.\u00a0\n\nOur supporting character is completely calm and collected, but our protagonist is clearly uncomfortable. The supporting character keeps a neutral expression, but our protagonist\u2019s face twists and scrunches with uncertainty. When they meet the person they came to talk to, the protagonist hides behind our supporting character\u2019s shoulder. When she sits down, she scoots as close to the edge of the couch as possible. You can tell she\u2019s uneasy but I don\u2019t have to say it directly. These are all little details that you can add to make your setting and characters more interesting and actually engage the reader.\u00a0\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have all of that right now, just get the plot beats done. But as you\u2019re expanding on your story, it will help if you can actually see yourself there, and get your readers to be there with you.\u00a0",

Now you edit, edit, edit and rewrite the crap out of your story. Over and over again, you add and change and take away. This is what makes bad writing readable, and sometimes even good.\n\nOther than that, read. Take note of what books you like, why you like them, when you find a description pleasing... and when you don't. You can practice describing things - short 300-500 word long pieces where you focus on making a description of something really come alive. Sit in the forest (or anywhere else of your choosing) and really notice everything with all of your senses: touch, sound, smell, appearance, taste. Write these things down. Remove unnecessary or repetitive words. Refine.\n\nGood luck! I personally get more joy and satisfaction from editing than I do the original word vomiting. But without the word vomiting I can never get to the editing part!",

Don't just passively absorb the story, *pay attention* to the way the author describes things, the way they move the plot forward and pace the story beats, and the way they develop the characters. \n\n2.) Write. It's not going to be good at first. Everyone starts out not great- it's a hobby that takes practice to get good at. The saying goes you can't edit a blank page; you need something there first.\n\n3.) Get feedback. A.) This feedback needs to be honest. This means don't give it to mom or your girlfriend or your close peer group. They'll tend to be nice, and you do NOT want nice. If it's hot garbage, you want to hear that so you can fix it. B.) The feedback *also* needs to be from people who know what they're talking about- other writers, English majors/teachers, etc. You want someone who knows how to identify the problems you have to be able to point them out to you, so you can move to the last step.\n\n4.) Take the feedback, and go fix it.\n\nIt's this four part process, repeated over and over and over again that will help hone you into a better writer.",

We still want to see people overcome challenges, and as long as the characters and obstacles are engaging, it'll be an interesting story.\n\nI'd suggest reading some more literary fiction - the vast majority of it does not deal with grand stakes and are pretty grounded. I mean, if you read Raymond Carver's \"Cathedral,\" it's a \"just\" story about a man learning to be more open-minded, more or less.\n\nRead \"Good Country People\" by Flannary O'Connor and you'll see it's \"just about\" being gullible.\n\nEven in spec-fic, you can still see very ground stories. Ken Liu's \"The Paper Menagerie\" is a story about coming to terms with having an immigrant mother.\n\nAll of these stories are engaging because the writing is interesting, the characters are believable / relatable, and the problems they are dealing with *feel real*.",

The pacing of a good book really depends on having scenes where there is always a clear goal for the POV character and stakes based on whether they succeed or fail in that scene.\n\nA novel needs a plot but a novel is more than a plot, it\u2019s a series of scenes and a plot is just the path through those scenes.",

        "content": "Focus on the internal conflict and interpersonal conflict.\n\nInterpersonal conflict between other characters helps highlight how other people deal with the same, or different, struggles. This is family dramas (Little Miss Sunshine), romances, work-based stories (The Office, Office Space), that sort of thing. These usually keep the external conflict very light. The focus is more on personal interactions and internal struggles. Something small happens externally, for all the characters to react to. This could be as simple as a broken copy machine, or a child bringing home a bad grade. Each character reacts, and then that either improves or worsens their individual internal struggles. Rinse and Repeat: External Event - Interpersonal Interactions - Internal Conflict. But external conflict has very little focus.\n\nIf you're not interested in interpersonal conflict, and want to focus mostly on internal conflict with some minor external conflict in the background, consider writing a Survival story. Think like 127 Hours. There is a major external conflict about survival, but most of the movie is internal conflict - he's not going anywhere, he's stuck between two rocks. It is all internal struggle, with small incremental progress made in the external survival conflict (find food to sustain himself, wiggle and worse to get loose, deal with wounds). But we spend most of the time in the character's head, listening to internal dialogue and handling internal struggles.\n\nHope that helps with direction. Not every story has tons of action or adventure and they can still be entertaining and great!\n\nPosted this in another thread and edited it slightly for this post as most of it seems to apply.",

Someone disagrees, or is resistant to the event/action/goal, however big or small. the characters might have some internal conflict or struggle that impedes them. Whatever works, the goal is just to make that simple plot beat harder or rougher to achieve.\n\nIn a way, adding conflict can also inject a lot of forward momentum into the story as it becomes more interesting, so it's also a great way to manage pacing in a story.",

But as often as not, while the character is technically trying to save the world, their concern is only really shown through a few characters- their love interest, or family, or whoever.  This makes sense, as you can't really introduce us to everyone in the world, and it gives a personal connection, and makes their potential loss feel all the more tangeable.\n\nBut you can have a personal connection without the world being at stake.  Consider your own life for the moment.  Let's say you are angling for a promotion.  In the grand scale of the universe, does it really matter if you get it?  Maybe not, but it matters a great deal to you.  Maybe it's the money, maybe it's the status, maybe it's the validation of a job well done.  The point is, it matters.\n\nConvince your audience that, to you, it is that important.  Make them feel it.\n\nAs an example: Legally Blonde.  Does it really matter if the main character is successful?  Maybe not, but by the end of the first act, we really want to see her succeed.\n\nInside out is another good example.  The scope of that story is as small as it is possible to be- one person's emotions.  And yet, we are made to feel that the story is important.  So we invest.",

However it wasnt until 5 months ago that I really started writing, I made a basic outline, ripped that up, made another one with the same premise but better story, after a lot of revising, planning, and a sleepless night due to my cat, I finally started writing my first book. Now i am 50k words into it, my outline is nearly complete (itd be done if not for the fact I work on it while im at work) and ive begun full revision for the first 4 chapters and the prologue. However I dont have any friends who enjoy reading, so the most feedback ive gotten from the beta chapters is that they like the amount of detail. Not exactly good feedback, id love to share what I have and get some opinions back on it. ",

Instead of beta readers, the writing group would have other writers who might be able to help you troubleshoot things on the creation side rather than just the reader-enjoyment side. You stand to learn more by discussing the craft with others who understand the process than just a reader. A writing group will also help you learn to identify problems in a manuscript as you read and critique others' work, which can help you in identifying the same problems in your own work. Overall, I think a writing group is a great place for a new-ish author to be working on their craft.",

You'll get a feel for how to weigh each person's individual advice on something based on their beliefs and habits. It can be much informative feedback than a beta reader who's preferences you don't necessarily know.\n\nThat being said, a writing group is absolutely a community. If you're not willing / don't have the time to be giving out critique and feedback to others to the same standard you want to receive, a writing group would be a bad fit. If you only want people to look at your novel and tell you what they think, then beta readers are going to be the way to go.\n\nThough it's usually too much to ask a beta reader to breakdown things minutely. You'll have to make do with a lot more vague things of \"I like / don't like this\" or \"This scene wasn't satisfying\" etc. and then figure out how to fix it.",

I had plenty of time to work on D&D stuff because it was important to me to get to play with my friends, a sunday every now and then. The majority of what i made went unused but it was a fantastic way to scratch the writing itch and allow my imagination to run rampant.

I didnt want to directly ask, and judging from the other commenter that was probably a good thing. Thank you for your comments however",

Personally, I absolutely love getting a character seriously injured and then letting that injury impact the future. For example, one of my characters loses a limb due to her main character flaw, at first this only impacts her emotionally but later down the line this fully results in her death. I have done similar things many times before, in fact if I give an injury, I always force myself to give it some consequence. So how do you guys treat injuries? Do you use it as a metaphor for character change, or maybe use it as a one time surprise and then move on?",

A lot of his character was actually bound in how he and his twin brother interacted as mirror images - many different times it comes up how he is no longer a mirror image with his scorched face, and what he can and cannot do with a missing eye.\n\nHe bumps into things that are on his right, and he must turn his head further if he wishes to see something to his right directly next to him. He always sits on the left side of his brother, so when he turns right to look at him, he needs to shift his whole body now. He was also the right-handed one - with this injury, he can no longer shoulder a rifle and use the scope effectively in his right. His brother had to teach him to shoot left handed and eyed.",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever written a story where a main character hasn\u2019t experienced at least some kind of injury (either in the past or present), bad luck, or a psychological moment. Plot armor is one of the most annoying things in a story to me(instant true love at first sight is #1).\n\nToo late to ask \u201cHow far am I willing to go?\u201d because if the above wasn\u2019t enough of a hint, I\u2019m not afraid to kill a character(I think my kill count is at least a dozen across the dozens of stories I\u2019ve written). Even then I think most deaths should have some kind of meaning behind them.\n\nAs for just injuries, no character should be perfectly safe - even if the story doesn\u2019t involve a dangerous villain, the character can still have some kind of accident, even a minor one. I\u2019ve written about characters getting beat up, some didn\u2019t know self defense while others did(both still took some amount of pain because none of my characters are the flawless superhero type), characters have been stabbed, shot, forcefully restrained, etc. Ironically though, I try to keep the actual gore factor rather mild, so while blood might be mentioned, I don\u2019t make the scene too visual.",

Like a character is mortally wounded, so decides to take out themselves and the enemies in one blaze of glory. It can work but often makes the sacrifice feel hollow since they were dead anyway, so they didn't sacrifice anything. It has to be written well to work, so the sacrifice isn't the focus but the act of saving the other characters or stopping the enemy or something.",

Pick any other element and someone somewhere has already had a power revolving around that.\n\nWrite your story. No matter what you do, there's going to be elements of it that someone can point to and say it's similar to something else.

There's no way in the world to be 100% original and devoid of any similarities to anything else. There's literally millions of stories in the world and we can trace a line of influence through literary history.\n\nShakespeare is one of the mots important writers in English. Guess what? Many of his stories were all popular stories that everyone knew. They weren't unique, just his presentation of them. If you go back, especially in theater, you'll find several famous playwrights have written plays based on the same story.\n\nSo, if anything, lean into it. If you start to realize you're treading familiar ground, see what you can use from those older stories and then be aware of what you're doing to make them unique. Because as long as you're not copying it word for word, character for character, beat for beat, it'll be different.",

Sure, it's been done before, but the context of MY SPECIFIC life has never been done before and will never be done again. The things that are unique to my circumstances, like my specific family dynamics, or encore memories from childhood experiences, etc, make everything else a new take on things that are otherwise universally true. I was not the first teenager who was angsty or depressed or into art or that played volleyball, who sang or dabbled in learning languages or woodworking or baking, but my specific instances of what I did are mine, and nothing can take it from me.\n\nSo, in the same way, give yourself a break. You are, most assuredly, subconsciously mimicking story beats you've ingested from other media sources before. Your characters can undoubtedly be broken down into well-known, tried-and-true character archetypes. Your plot twist was probably used, in a different context, by anywhere from one to one thousand other writers.\n\nStorytelling is as old as society itself. The things you are copying exist to be copied because they work as storytelling tools for a reason.\n\nYour idea is still original, regardless of the fact that you cannot claim sole ownership of the framework. Just write the thing. And if you find it is too close to something, legitimately, work with an expert in the field to see how much needs to be edited and how much you can proudly proclaim came to you on your own.\n\nYou got this.

Unless you're asking about punctuation in prologues . . . \n\nTo actually answer the question I *think* you're asking: plenty of chapters are titled, and titling your prologue isn't any different. You'd either just have the title - IE \"Learning to Title\" at the top center and then carry on, or \"Prologue\" followed by a hard return to the next like and then \"Learning to Title.\"\n\nBut really, whether you do it that way or \"Prologue: Learning to Title\" doesn't really matter. As long as it's clear, it'll work just fine, and if you're ever publishing it, there'll be some in house style that they'll want to adhere to.

I\u2019ve been inspired to start doing it by video essayists on YouTube (shoutout to the GOAT Jacob Geller), because the format of writing something that\u2019s somewhat script-like is something that just comes easy to me anyway, and I enjoy examining pieces of media in a similar way that Jacob does with video games. fiction writing is fun, but it\u2019s always an incredibly slow and sometimes aggravating process for me. also, I\u2019m in high school, so if I can hone my essay skills outside of the classroom.. that\u2019s a bonus :^) \n\nhowever, I wanted to ask about two things. one: is there somewhere I can share the things I write? I was thinking maybe a blog or Tumblr, but if there\u2019s somewhere more specific for people to share what is essentially non-fiction yapping I\u2019d love to know. if I had the time and the technology, I\u2019d teach myself video editing and actually make my essays into video essays, but I don\u2019t. so is there somewhere to share just the writing? \n\ntwo: is it necessary to.. cite your sources, I guess? or at least polite? many of the video essayists that I enjoy are very well-read people, and while I consider myself somewhat intellectual too, I\u2019m not at the level they\u2019re at. if I write about a topic, let\u2019s say for example \u201cdepictions of the afterlife in media\u201d, would I have to be knowledgeable enough to yank like ten different examples that I\u2019ve read/played/watched? or is it okay to maybe just do a few? idk, this may be a stupid question but I figured it was worth asking anyway.",

BUT this is also my second full-length project that's become stuck around this point, so maybe I'm just a baby-author who's biting off more than I can chew?",

I wrote myself into a weird corner and couldn't figure out how to get to the end I had in mind. I ended up erasing a few chapters and redirecting things.\n\n\nNow with a side project I'm experimenting with vague bullet point chapter outlines and having a lot more success (writing so much faster too). While doing this method, I was able to get out of my pantser corner in a fraction of the time and can focus on just writing the story. As I go some things change a little, but it's mostly the same. No fancy sheets or software, just bullet points and basic character blurbs in Google docs.",

I can have tons of ideas, yet none that inspires me enough to actually *do something* about it. I might claim I want to write, but I lack the *passion*.\n\nI am far too obsessed with *method*, with finding out how one \"should\" write instead of, well, actually writing.\n\nBecause if I try to \"just write\", as many often encourage, I might get one scene out of it. Never more, because I don't know where I'm heading \u2014 I can't visualise it.\n\nAnd if I try to plan carefully, it just doesn't flow. No way to know what comes next, let alone where it will end.\n\nI think those \"cheap ideas\" are simply not the ones that really drive me. Yet I *know* execution is king, and anything can become a masterpiece in good hands. Hells, many of my favourite reads sounded awful based on their premise alone.\n\nDoes anyone have any specific advice on how to find passion from \"cheap ideas\"?",

How would it be offensive? To who?\n\nTo actually address the question: think of what range the character has, and use those words to the greatest extent possible. For example, when I'm speaking my second language, I *heavily* reuse the words I know even when there are better suited words (that I don't know) in a situation. You'd be amazed at how versatile a few words can be of getting your point across.\n\nOther than that, especially if the narrating POV has a way to understand the character beyond speech, I would lean heavily into \"He made an affirmative grunt\" or \"He let out that sigh that meant he was annoyed.\" Body language and non-word noises can get a lot done.\n\nJust keep it simple. It'll be really weird the more complex you try to make nonverbal stuff. \"He grunted as if to say that the universe and everything in it would eventually lead to entropy and nothing mattered anyways\" would read very oddly, for example.",

My character is a rich, extremely materialistic 19 yo. ukranian kid who escaped the country as a baby after the war broke out. He mysteriously gets 300k dollars from his startup company stolen from him when he was in a coma after an accident. He swears to find who stole his money and becomes a local vigilante in the process using his skills in martial arts and sword fighting to protect Miamis increasingly dangerous russian-speaking neighborhoods. He takes on the name cossack and eventually comes head-to-head with a former oligarch in exile who he is keen on defeating after a big revelation. Throughout the story he learns how to give to others and how to appreciate what he has while also honing his combat abillities. I am not eastern european myself but many of my friends(many of whom inspired the character of cossack) are and i love the culture and the history. Can someone here teach me more about ukranian culture and cossack history? Id love to learn more and i want this story to be as culturally accurate as possible. Slava ukraini!",

Cossacks were mostly peasants who wanted to live as freemen and therefore run away to Zaporizhia and Wild Fields as the region was called back then.\n\nCossacks were mainly warriors, later serving as mercenaries in magnate or PLC/Russian armies. They used mainly sabres and bows or hand guns. Often used horses and even organized invasion on Istanbul on boats. Important decisions were often made through discussion between officers and the elected leader (ataman)\n\nThey used to wear loose clothes related to Polish and Turkish/Tatar clothing of that time and had relatively characteristic hair with almost entire had shaved and some hair left on the very top, sometimes very long. Polish nobility often shaved their hair too but left entire top of the head.\n\nThat's all that comes to my maind as of now",

        "content": "It\u2019s totally a thing that happens in fiction all the time, and it can be super powerful if done right! I love a good speech in a movie or book, you know, the kind where you\u2019re ready to fight dragons or something right alongside the characters. So, a few things I\u2019ve noticed when it comes to writing speeches: \n\nFirst, it really helps to know your audience within the story. Like, what do they need to hear? Are they nervous, doubtful, or just in need of motivation? Tailoring the speech to their emotions can make it more convincing. Also, start with a strong hook or statement to grab their attention, it could be a bold declaration or something really relatable that hits home for them. \n\nThen, build it up gradually. Use real life examples, analogies, or stories that the audience knows about. Break down your points in a way that they keep getting more gripping and make sure it stays relevant. And, oh, don\u2019t underestimate the power of a good pause. I think letting some words hang there can add so much tension and drama.\n\nLastly, end it with a bang! You need to nail that closer, the part they\u2019ll all be buzzing about after. Call them to action, rally them together, or remind them of what they stand to gain or lose. I\u2019d say just have some fun with it and really get into the character\u2019s head. I remember writing a speech for a character, and I stood in front of my mirror pretending to be them, like full-on acting it out. It sounds a bit crazy, but it helped me feel the emotions and tweak the words to sound more natural. \n\nAnd seriously, those epic speeches are the ones you remember, so it\u2019s definitely worth putting in that extra effort. It\u2019s like, just think of all the iconic speeches we see in movies. They give you chills... you know?",

This also applies to transitions between major story points.\n\n\nFor me, it's \"make it gayer, add an action scene, add more politics.\" My suggestion is to find those things you LOVE writing, that make you happy, and use them to compel your story forward when you don't know what else to do. How to get from the beginning to the middle? Use what you love and find interesting as a baseline!\n\n\nMight not work for everyone but it's also helped my pacing issues (thus the action scene option\u2014 if I feel bored by my story, so does the reader).",

The (in)actions of person A create external conflict with person B, if they don't match, from person B's point of view (not their own inner struggle), yes.

If you don't know your characters well enough (yet) and struggle with the romance part, let the fantasy part (action and adventures) take over for a while. Give them problems. Huge problems. You'll see who they really are beyond their breaking point.\n\nYou may write yourself into a corner more than once, but treat it like a game, try a different path and see what happens. And it likely will remove the need to plan / invent \"better relationship drama\".\n\nAnother approach is to literally interview your characters, like sitting in a tavern and having a chat. If nothing comes out of it (it's just a more playful way of planning their character, after all), put them back in action. More dragons are helpful sometimes.",

        "content": "Community views on the use of AI generated imagery as a writing prompt\n\nHi folks, \n\nMy friend and I have been experimenting with using AI generated images as the basis of story prompts.\n\nSomeone we know will put in a random prompt (secret from us) into Midjourney, and then send us the image along with a format or style (short story, poem, noir, script). We then have a week to write that format/style using the image as inspiration. \n\nSo, for example, the image could be of a black and white Victorian street, and we have to write a horror short story. Or the image is a spooky Halloween setting, and we have to write a poem to suit. We then come back after a week and compare how we approached the task.\n\nI have found it a blast, and genuinely some of my best work. There are often elements to the image that just spark the imagination and let the ideas flow (picture is worth a thousand words). \n\nHowever, as you may have guessed, it strays into the nebulous world of AI use in a creative context, and I totally understand and empathise with distrust. I want to make it clear that any writing itself is entirely our own work. The only AI use is in the image sent to us. Yes, we could hire an illustrator to do that, or something similar, but to me that means we are simply using someone else's creative image, not something, hopefully, somewhat random.\n\nI'd love to know what fellow writers think of this use-case. Is it unsettling? Do you love the idea? Are we scoundrels?\n\nWe are worried about ever submitting some of this work to competitions, or publishing, for fear of community backlash because of the AI use. I'd feel better getting a sense of whether that is justified or not, from people who care about the craft. \n\nTl;dr - are people okay with projects using AI images as visual prompts to spark creativity, as long as the subsequent writing itself is fully human-created?",
