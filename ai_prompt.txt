Title: What do you put in cover letters for short story contest submissions?
Content: In the submission form for a short story contest where we're asked to scrub our names from the submission, the document name, etc. they gave a box for an optional cover letter to accompany the entry. I'm confused about what I'm supposed to put in a cover letter. The judges have to read the entries, so it's not like a magazine submission where you need to pitch story, and I'm pretty sure I can't include a bio because why would the judge be allowed that information when they can't even see our names?

What the heck would you put in this cover letter?

Title: Writing apps for syncing on phone and PC?
Content: Hello

I am working on a novel, and I am currently using google docs, however, I would love a more specific writing app like scrivener, however, it does not allow for android users, such as I, to use it. I am thus asking for recommendations.

Featues I would love:

- Syncing
- Offline mode on phone, although not neccesary
- Autosave
- Tracking progress

Is any such products available?

│  Syncing is a paid service, but you can easily just have your vault (obsidian documents) saved in a Google drive folder and it’ll sync.  
│  It's offline by default, autosave as well. Tracking progress is easily added with a plugin. Just like thousands of other things.

│  So, I’m kinda stuck at a certain point in a chapter where my character Elizabeth is being questioned by an old man named Albin where she got so much money from. Some background: 
│  
│  Elizabeth technically fakes her death by >!killing herself!< but her magic, which is stealing souls, lets her use the stolen souls and gives her a second chance at life but she now has a different appearance. Anyway, her friend Alexander gives her a bag of money (basically just a bunch of gold and silver coins.) which is enough for her to live easily for a year. By the way, she wakes up in the forest after getting revived. She also had a ton of scars on her old body and in a manic episode of hers, she tore off a lot of her dress to make sure she had no scars. After spending a night in the forest, she makes it out, senses the old man, his mule, and the cart he’s carrying. Blah blah, Albin decides to help her because she’s seems the same age as his granddaughter. 
│  
│  Reason why Elizabeth faked her death: Because she was experimented and tortured by her father, and got a lot of her magic stolen, or rather was now being forcefully shared and the only way to stop it was if she were to die. So she did it with no hesitation. 
│  
│  Back to background: Albin asks why she was in the forest in the first place. Elizabeth gets nervous and says she ran away from home. Technically the truth, but she believes she’s lying. Albin just looks at her and sees tears, doesn’t question it further. Albin is still hesitant, even says he can’t trust her because bandits send bait like her to lure old men like him often, but Elizabeth assures him she’s not. 
│  
│  Cut to where I’m at: Albin and Elizabeth are now in a village that’s close to Albin’s village. Albin told her she needs a new a dress as her current on is too inappropriate and it even has blood on it. (She snapped her leg in half when she ran away in the middle of the night, but that’s not important.) Albin tells her he’ll pay because he assumes she has no money, Elizabeth goes inside the tailors shop, buys 10 dresses, wakes up Albin, surprises him with her new dress and Albin is in shock of how she bought all that and sees what’s inside the bag of coins she has. 
│  
│  Now, important details: Elizabeth told Albin she got the money from a friend. Just that. Even she doesn’t know where Alexander, the friend, got the money from and she can’t tell Albin of his occupation. Why? Because someone who knows Albin is someone who also knew Elizabeth before she faked her death. If Elizabeth tells Albin that Alexander is a foot soldier in training, and he just gave her some of his salary, Albin could go to Joseph(the man Albin knows) and ask him about it. By the way, Joseph trained Alexander when he was a boy and a young teen. He even knows everything about how the kingdom’s military works, so any detail about Alexander would make Joseph think of him. And Joseph already saw Elizabeth in this village, but her new appearance saved her. So, Elizabeth is on edge. Right now I just made her by time by saying she could explain everything while they’re on the way to Albin’s village. I don’t know what to do after that because the excuses have to be amazing, and I’m having a hard time thinking.

Title: Discussion: The Paradox of the "Info Dump"
Content: The "info dump" is often scorned as the death knell of good storytelling. Conventional wisdom tells us it will suffocate a story: stalling the plot with long, bloated passages and overwhelming the reader with unnecessary detail.

Yet, in the hands of a skilled writer, an info-dump can be a thing of beauty: a moment of indulgent world-building or cerebral delight that enriches the narrative rather than derailing it.

Take Moby-Dick, where Melville spends entire chapters dissecting the minutiae of whaling (from the anatomy of a sperm whale’s head to the precise mechanics of rendering blubber into oil). It ought to feel excruciating, yet it’s intoxicating; because Melville’s voice is so alive with curiosity and obsession that we get drawn into his spiral.

These digressions aren’t just trivia; they build atmosphere, deepen theme, and immerse us so completely in the whaling world that by the time Ahab faces the white whale, every historical, philosophical, and biological detail feels like part of the harrowing weight bearing down on him.

But the true magic of an info-dump isn’t just in its prose (it’s in its payoff). Take Dune, where Herbert frontloads the novel with dense political, ecological, and theological exposition about Arrakis, the spice melange, and the Fremen way of life. It could have been dry, but when Paul Atreides is thrust into the desert, every detail we absorbed suddenly matters. We understand why stillsuits work, why the Fremen fight the way they do, why the worms are sacred. Without that avalanche of context, Paul's transformation into Muad’Dib wouldn’t feel earned.

Sometimes, an info-dump is just a joy to read. Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett built their careers on them, filling The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and Discworld with ridiculous tangents that have no direct bearing on plot (yet they are the soul of their books), the reason people return to them again and again.

IMO cinema’s influence on writing guidance has villainized the info dump, favoring economic storytelling (with mass appeal) over the sheer pleasure of slow exploration. Don’t mistake a reader’s unwillingness to engage with your story's lore as a failure of your writing. If an info dump is well-crafted (either it pays off or it’s simply fun) then it deserves its place.




TLDR: A well-crafted info-dump isn’t a storytelling flaw. It can be immersive; provided it either pays off later or it is fun to read.

│  │

They were harnessed, their swords smelted, and their banners burned. They were forced to drag rocks on their own shields, grinding the sigils of their families down to faded obscurity. The halls still echoed with the ragged breath of men who once bled for their king, worked to death while hauling his ass into a throne."

│  │  │  │  
│  │  │  │  Incorporating inner monologues or inner thoughts (well at-home in 1st-person narration), is a great way of working through direct exposition in a wah that feels engaging. But inner monologues in true 3rd-person narration is stupidly tricky. Right now, I’m experimenting with a project that uses third-person omniscient narration with the inner monologues of multiple characters, all running simultaneously (like dialogue). It’s an absolute nightmare to manage with clarity and without sounding either redundant or frantic; totally inconvenient, hardly worth the trouble. I wouldn’t recommend it.

You are sometimes zoomed out to what is basically a 'storyteller' perspective, then you slide into the mind of a particular character, then leave it and slide into somebody else. This is not a flaw, it's a feature!

Title: How Important is a HIGH CONCEPT Idea for a Novel?
Content: A couple of days ago I wrote a post asking about how important a great hook is to a story. But none of the responses seemed to get at what I actually meant. And I was later informed by a user that what I was getting at was actually called a "high concept" premise. And so I figured I'd make this post and ask about what I was actually pondering: Basically, my goal is trad publishing, and more often than not, I've ideas for stories that lack a unique/high concept. It's just about a character, a person; their circumstance. And usually when I've idea for a high concept, it's attached to ideas for stories that I've no clue how to write; stories I don't even know if I can write. Not just technically, but emotionally. And so as of late, I've started to worry... if my goal is trad publishing, should I try and figure these hook-laden high concept ideas out despite the fact that I'm not sure I can even write them, or is this kind of mindset destructive? How important is a high concept for a great book?

Yes I'm in highschool and these type of anime and animations are my source of entertainment. I have a draft but I feel like it is very vague can I request some help?

The "Draft" more like outline of the story I guess:

Itsuki, growing up in the peri-urban area of Osaka, he finds himself falling in love with Miyako, which the build up of their relationship  increases slowly, when it finally ends in an abrupt fall into the ground and then a slow cutoff from each other (Miyako believes Itsuki was unable to express his feelings for her leaving her in a limbo and for herself she moves on (ghosting him which he goes on a whole side quest to get closer where she explains the latter)). Then the slow healing process begins when the abrupt ghosting happens where Miyako cuts contact to Itsuki, he finds Tsubasa, she is a kind and sweet girl with a rocky past connected to people using her, her parents neglecting and her spiralling emotionally. She finds peace in Itsuki, he returns the feelings and they have their moment, a real healthy relationship but Itsuki can’t stand the fact that Miyako hangs out with boys more than girls, he has a whole part where he confronts her and she explains the girls in her class see her as an outcast but she makes efforts and is slowly closer to the girls cutting off Itsuki’s overthinking. After becoming official with Miyako, Itsuki starts reminiscing about his unrequited love with Miyako where he tracks her down to ask for closure, he feels he wants to be with her but clearly sees she is with someone else and is only entertaining his small talk. Soon he will loose Tsubasa after spiralling himself to “attain” Miyako’s love, Tsubasa becomes suicidal but finds herself a new man Akugawa who really loves her unlike Itsuki’s true self. Itsuki unable to make his love’s ends meet he spirals into a dark, treacherous path…

DO NOT write a romance novel like an anime and hope it turns out well. It won’t. Most anime tropes only work in anime. Removed from that context they come across as childish and amateurish.

Title: Rules of writing

I know the ”golden” rule: Show, don’t tell.

I also recently found out you shouldn’t head hop.

What are some other important rules that shouldn’t be broken if you wish to be published some day?

│  │  │  With third omniscient, you need to make sure that your voice is also on point, as everything should be coming from that, well, *omniscient* narrator.

│  │  │  With third limited and first person POVs, you need to make some distinction between the different POVs in terms of voice, thoughts, etch.

I think u/Content_Audience690 nailed it as far as, in general, there are times it is done poorly and it has impacted the audience. I think it has something to do with the fact that books are so accessible now and just about anyone can put one out, it's not like it used to be where a book at least couldn't be completely awful and get published. Readers are tired of investing themselves and getting disappointed. And I understand that.

│  │  │  │  What I have learned from feedback, more than anything, is that that individual books are not for everyone. I have beta readers that love my POV swaps. They still provide constructive criticism on other areas. Or about the POV swap if it isn't sufficiently clear. But there are some readers that are simply not interested. And that's ok.

Obviously, it wasn’t if this was coming up. 
│  │  │  │  │  
│  │  │  │  │  And it SUCKED to hear that. But instead of going “I’m right, you’re wrong,” I sat around and thought about what I could do better to make it clearer, while also being able to remove a lengthy preamble at the beginning about the magic. 
│  │  │  │  │  
│  │  │  │  │  If the feedback is something that only one person is pointing out, you can probably brush it off as an opinion. (Same beta reader somehow came to the conclusion that the villain was the MC’s mother in disguise? Which no one else had ever even threw out as a joke theory.) This was feedback I could brush off, as it wasn’t a recurring problem. 
│  │  │  │  │  
│  │  │  │  │  You’re obviously young and new to your writing journey. There’s a lot of learning that takes time. When I wrote my first book, I refused to take any criticism that I didn’t like. However, that didn’t make me a stronger writer. It held me back. 
│  │  │  │  │  
│  │  │  │  │  But as you are still in the middle of writing your book, I would honestly advise you to wait until you’re done with the entire first draft before engaging outside feedback. Actually, write your draft. Put it away for a few weeks, if not a few months, to give yourself distance from the text. Do your first comb over after that, and THEN pass to beta readers for feedback. 
│  │  │  │  │  
│  │  │  │  │  A lot of the issue is that when you are currently writing, you are too close to the material. You know what’s going on in your head, but it doesn’t always translate onto the page. When you give yourself that distance, you can come back and go “wait, what did I mean here?”
│  │  │  │  │  
│  │  │  │  │  Right now YOU think that your narrative flows well because you know everything that’s going on. Your readers do not. It’s your job to make sure they understand, and that’s not a matter of taste, but a matter of craft.

│  │  │  │  │  │  The feedback comes from theoretical discussions in which I talk about third person omniscient. Rather passionately. "But there are some readers that are simply not interested." was in reference to that.

Calling a situation overused and labeling it as a cliche, although it is so real with its consequences, roots in the way of execution. - And in this case, shyness on the *first* date isn't necessarily the trope, but just one scene/situation of many, within a romance novel.

│  │  │  │  Another example, from the world of Anime (Naruto), where the trigger of the main story is about #A being betrayed by #B. This was not really overused by that time, but since then, any other similar idea after that, was called a cliche by many, although the cores of those new stories were completely based on it, making it its own trope.
│  │  │  │  
│  │  │  │  And calling a supposedly cliche a trope in a book, can also mean, that the personal interest in it was so big, that the author put alot of effort into it, to lift its cliche level to the level of trope. That actually could be an example for a good execution, and won't negate neither my nor your idea either.
│  │  │  │  
│  │  │  │  There is also no warrant, that a trope is immune of turning into a cliche, or that utilizing something overused not as a trope, will turn it into a cliche. In both cases, effort can be the key. A bad maintained trope can be a cliche, while a well executed overused non-trope scene can escape from being called a cliche.

Title: I'm sick of world building…
Content: I've been reading a book per month for the last year, during which time I've grown more and more sick of all the drawn out descriptions of people, surroundings, landscapes, objects, … Just tell me the story, I'm fine filling in the blanks with my own fantasy. 

Am I the only one feeling this way? 

Apart from reading, I've also been writing, and I noticed how I just don't feel inspired to write a whole paragraph describing something "for the sake of immersion" when instead I just want to tell my story. It might put off some people, but I like how it makes the writing much more fast-paced and to the point. The downside is that the book turns out to be pretty short (25k words), but I feel like I've told the story I wanted to tell. Should it make an effort to "describe more things" just to make it more lengthy?

What are your thoughts?

│  Presently, I think that the problem is that people do the world-building too afraid that people will find it confusing if they don't explain everything. You s*hould* pour long descriptions into the look of the town, the architecture used, the kinds of people on the streets. You *should* tell use what is engraved upon the sword or what is embroidered on the banners hanging over the king's throne. What you should *not* do is tell us why.
│  
│  I think right now where a lot of authors get caught up is this need to explain why everything is the way it is. A patient reader wants to be entertained and so long as the characters in the world act like this is perfectly natural the reader will not question things too much.
│  
│  An example for instance would be to have a female character say, "Both of my husbands recommended I try training under you. They say you're the finest duelist in the city."
│  
│  And instead of then saying in your prose something like 'Fakelandia was, after all, a matriarchy. Women would take two, three, sometimes five husbands. Rich women would often have a veritable platoon of grooms following them about.' you could just have the sword master go, "They were not wrong, ma'am!

│  Or, the more explicit world-building is actually plot development. You are literally saying - here is the story of this world, and the story of this world IS the story I am telling. Which is legitimate, if you can make it interesting. Personally, I love a bit of well-told world history... but it needs to be that; it needs to be a story, a history, it needs to be more than just an exposition dump born of a writer's insecurity (like they're leaning over your shoulder and saying "I need to give you some context here or you won't get it...")
│

Title: How do you go from word vomit to something more readable (total amateur here!)
Content: I’m writing a novel truly for the sake of writing. No intentions of going pro, but I have all the intentions of finishing the story. I’m struggling to keep going because I feel like a terrible writer. 

However, I’m trying to hone my craft and find when I’m inspired and motivated to write my story, it comes out as word vomit. It’s very “he said she said” and “he was tall. He had brown hair” with zero creative descriptions of that makes sense.  

I feel like I’m trying to invent words that don’t exist just to make my sentences sound more like the books I enjoy reading. I want to convey more emotion, more depth but struggle to find words that don’t feel cliche. 

What are some ways I can improve? Resources? Practice exercises?

│  Firstly READ MORE. Pay attention to what the writer is doing. Take mental notes when you like a particular technique.
│  
│  \-----------------
│  
│  I think the quickest/easiest shortcuts to strong prose are:
│  
│  **1. VERBS** \- use strong, specific verbs and avoid adverbs - 'He sprinted' instead of 'He ran quicky', 'The mouse scurried away' instead of 'The mouse ran away'. Also try to use active verbs instead of 'to be' verbs, e.g. 'Rice had been spilled all over the floor' instead of 'There was rice all over the floor'.
│  
│  >he was tall. He had brown hair”
│  
│  These are poor because they use 'to be' verbs ('was' and 'had') instead of action verbs. The sentences themselves are fine, but usually this kind of wording is dull. By using better verbs these could become:
│  
│  "He towered over me. His flowing brown hair was practically touching the clouds!"
│  
│  This is similar to what people mean when they say 'show, don't tell'. Don't tell the reader a character was tired, show them yawning or rubbing their eyes.
│  
│  **2. VARIETY** \- change sentence lengths and structures to create rhythm and avoid monotony. Short sentences are great for action, longer ones for introspection. Try rewording sentences with different words at the start instead of always defaulting to 'noun verb' all the time.
│  
│  **3. TRIM** \- Cut excess words. 'The bank manager' is better than 'The manager of the bank'. Small words are often unnecessary, especially when there are many in a sentence. Try rewording more cleanly.  
│  \-----------------
│  
│  As for resources, the Internet is full of them. Search for articles and videos about prose writing. Look up the various writing aid software available that can point out potential ways to improve. There are also books like [https://mybook.to/MEEtjd3](https://mybook.to/MEEtjd3) , which has lots of examples and exercises to practices with.

│  
│  Now, with that being said, even if you write mostly for yourself, the best way to improve is to let other people read your work. It sounds counterintuitive to the notion of "writing for yourself", I know, but a second, or even third perspective is invaluable to spotting mistakes that you are blind to. You don't have to take your readers' word for gospel, just pick and choose which you feel would make your writing better. 
│  
│  You mention feeling too mechanical with your prose, especially on descriptions and dialogue tags. I think the best way to address this other than having someone (preferably an experienced reader/writer) read your work is to read more. Generic advice, I know, but trying to imitate a style, especially if you're not planning to publish, isn't bad at all. If you want to make it more 'yours' still, then you can read whatever your favorite book is, then compare it with your previous writings and think up of ways to implement the elements of the book you love to your own writing.

│  Read more books that are relevant to what you would like to write. Draw some broad themes and such from them. There’s no crime in that. And visualize! Put yourself in that world. Imagine what the setting looks like when you walk in, what the characters faces look like as they’re speaking, the gestures that they do, imagine what sounds you would hear, what you would smell. Engage all five senses as you immerse yourself in the world. That’s the main principle of “show, don’t tell”.
│  
│  For example, I have a scene where two characters enter a mostly abandoned apartment complex. The elevator is metal and rickety, and it screeches as it opens. The windows sag because they’ve never been replaced. The paint on the outside is crumbled and peeling. There’s a smell of water damage. Electricity from an exposed wire hisses and crackles. 
│  
│  Our supporting character is completely calm and collected, but our protagonist is clearly uncomfortable. The supporting character keeps a neutral expression, but our protagonist’s face twists and scrunches with uncertainty. When they meet the person they came to talk to, the protagonist hides behind our supporting character’s shoulder. When she sits down, she scoots as close to the edge of the couch as possible. You can tell she’s uneasy but I don’t have to say it directly. These are all little details that you can add to make your setting and characters more interesting and actually engage the reader. 
│  
│  You don’t have to have all of that right now, just get the plot beats done. But as you’re expanding on your story, it will help if you can actually see yourself there, and get your readers to be there with you.

│  
│  Other than that, read. Take note of what books you like, why you like them, when you find a description pleasing... and when you don't. You can practice describing things - short 300-500 word long pieces where you focus on making a description of something really come alive. Sit in the forest (or anywhere else of your choosing) and really notice everything with all of your senses: touch, sound, smell, appearance, taste. Write these things down.

The focus is more on personal interactions and internal struggles. Something small happens externally, for all the characters to react to. This could be as simple as a broken copy machine, or a child bringing home a bad grade. Each character reacts, and then that either improves or worsens their individual internal struggles. Rinse and Repeat: External Event - Interpersonal Interactions - Internal Conflict. But external conflict has very little focus.
│  
│  If you're not interested in interpersonal conflict, and want to focus mostly on internal conflict with some minor external conflict in the background, consider writing a Survival story. Think like 127 Hours. There is a major external conflict about survival, but most of the movie is internal conflict - he's not going anywhere, he's stuck between two rocks. It is all internal struggle, with small incremental progress made in the external survival conflict (find food to sustain himself, wiggle and worse to get loose, deal with wounds). But we spend most of the time in the character's head, listening to internal dialogue and handling internal struggles.

Title: Writing groups or beta readers?
Content: Hey everyone, im new to the sub. Ive been an aspiring writer for roughly 7 years, since the begining of HS. However it wasnt until 5 months ago that I really started writing, I made a basic outline, ripped that up, made another one with the same premise but better story, after a lot of revising, planning, and a sleepless night due to my cat, I finally started writing my first book. Now i am 50k words into it, my outline is nearly complete (itd be done if not for the fact I work on it while im at work) and ive begun full revision for the first 4 chapters and the prologue. However I dont have any friends who enjoy reading, so the most feedback ive gotten from the beta chapters is that they like the amount of detail. Not exactly good feedback, id love to share what I have and get some opinions back on it.

Instead of beta readers, the writing group would have other writers who might be able to help you troubleshoot things on the creation side rather than just the reader-enjoyment side. You stand to learn more by discussing the craft with others who understand the process than just a reader. A writing group will also help you learn to identify problems in a manuscript as you read and critique others' work, which can help you in identifying the same problems in your own work.

│  │  │  A writing group is a fine place to get feedback, especially once you've spent some time working on each others' stories. You'll get a feel for how to weigh each person's individual advice on something based on their beliefs and habits. It can be much informative feedback than a beta reader who's preferences you don't necessarily know.

If you're not willing / don't have the time to be giving out critique and feedback to others to the same standard you want to receive, a writing group would be a bad fit. If you only want people to look at your novel and tell you what they think, then beta readers are going to be the way to go.

Title: How far are you willing to go on injuries?
Content: I've noticed recently that a lot of people I know are turned off from the idea of giving their characters injuries and giving actual consequences to them. Personally, I absolutely love getting a character seriously injured and then letting that injury impact the future. For example, one of my characters loses a limb due to her main character flaw, at first this only impacts her emotionally but later down the line this fully results in her death. I have done similar things many times before, in fact if I give an injury, I always force myself to give it some consequence. So how do you guys treat injuries? Do you use it as a metaphor for character change, or maybe use it as a one time surprise and then move on?

Title: How Do You Get Over the Fear of Non-Originality?
Content: Hey fellow writers,

Every time I start writing a story, I hit this wall where I feel like what I’m doing has already been done before. Whether it’s a certain plot structure, a trope, or just a character arc that feels familiar, I start doubting myself and questioning whether I’m just unconsciously copying something I’ve seen or read before.

I know that “everything has been done” to some extent, but how do you personally push past that fear? How do you keep writing even when you worry that your work isn’t truly original? And how do you deal with the anxiety of unintentionally writing something too close to another existing work?

│  I think this is why some of the best advice given to younger writers is "write what you want to write" rather than writing toward some trend. There's no way in the world to be 100% original and devoid of any similarities to anything else. There's literally millions of stories in the world and we can trace a line of influence through literary history.

│  Shakespeare is one of the mots important writers in English. Guess what? Many of his stories were all popular stories that everyone knew. They weren't unique, just his presentation of them. If you go back, especially in theater, you'll find several famous playwrights have written plays based on the same story.
│  
│  So, if anything, lean into it. If you start to realize you're treading familiar ground, see what you can use from those older stories and then be aware of what you're doing to make them unique. Because as long as you're not copying it word for word, character for character, beat for beat, it'll be different.

│  To actually answer the question I *think* you're asking: plenty of chapters are titled, and titling your prologue isn't any different. You'd either just have the title - IE "Learning to Title" at the top center and then carry on, or "Prologue" followed by a hard return to the next like and then "Learning to Title."

Title: A couple questions about essay writing for fun
Content: hey, as the title says, I’m trying to start writing what I would call “essays”, but I had a few questions. I’ve been inspired to start doing it by video essayists on YouTube (shoutout to the GOAT Jacob Geller), because the format of writing something that’s somewhat script-like is something that just comes easy to me anyway, and I enjoy examining pieces of media in a similar way that Jacob does with video games. fiction writing is fun, but it’s always an incredibly slow and sometimes aggravating process for me. also, I’m in high school, so if I can hone my essay skills outside of the classroom.. that’s a bonus :^) 

however, I wanted to ask about two things. one: is there somewhere I can share the things I write? I was thinking maybe a blog or Tumblr, but if there’s somewhere more specific for people to share what is essentially non-fiction yapping I’d love to know. if I had the time and the technology, I’d teach myself video editing and actually make my essays into video essays, but I don’t. so is there somewhere to share just the writing? 

two: is it necessary to.. cite your sources, I guess? or at least polite? many of the video essayists that I enjoy are very well-read people, and while I consider myself somewhat intellectual too, I’m not at the level they’re at. if I write about a topic, let’s say for example “depictions of the afterlife in media”, would I have to be knowledgeable enough to yank like ten different examples that I’ve read/played/watched? or is it okay to maybe just do a few? idk, this may be a stupid question but I figured it was worth asking anyway.

For example, when I'm speaking my second language, I *heavily* reuse the words I know even when there are better suited words (that I don't know) in a situation. You'd be amazed at how versatile a few words can be of getting your point across.

Title: Any Ukrainian writers here?
Content: Hi, im brainstorming ideas for a story about a cossack superhero in a near-future Miami 13 years after a destructive civil war ravaged America. My character is a rich, extremely materialistic 19 yo. ukranian kid who escaped the country as a baby after the war broke out. He mysteriously gets 300k dollars from his startup company stolen from him when he was in a coma after an accident. He swears to find who stole his money and becomes a local vigilante in the process using his skills in martial arts and sword fighting to protect Miamis increasingly dangerous russian-speaking neighborhoods. He takes on the name cossack and eventually comes head-to-head with a former oligarch in exile who he is keen on defeating after a big revelation. Throughout the story he learns how to give to others and how to appreciate what he has while also honing his combat abillities. I am not eastern european myself but many of my friends(many of whom inspired the character of cossack) are and i love the culture and the history. Can someone here teach me more about ukranian culture and cossack history? Id love to learn more and i want this story to be as culturally accurate as possible. Slava ukraini!

│  It’s totally a thing that happens in fiction all the time, and it can be super powerful if done right! I love a good speech in a movie or book, you know, the kind where you’re ready to fight dragons or something right alongside the characters. So, a few things I’ve noticed when it comes to writing speeches: 
│  
│  First, it really helps to know your audience within the story. Like, what do they need to hear? Are they nervous, doubtful, or just in need of motivation? Tailoring the speech to their emotions can make it more convincing. Also, start with a strong hook or statement to grab their attention, it could be a bold declaration or something really relatable that hits home for them. 
│  
│  Then, build it up gradually. Use real life examples, analogies, or stories that the audience knows about. Break down your points in a way that they keep getting more gripping and make sure it stays relevant. And, oh, don’t underestimate the power of a good pause. I think letting some words hang there can add so much tension and drama.
│  
│  Lastly, end it with a bang! You need to nail that closer, the part they’ll all be buzzing about after. Call them to action, rally them together, or remind them of what they stand to gain or lose. I’d say just have some fun with it and really get into the character’s head. I remember writing a speech for a character, and I stood in front of my mirror pretending to be them, like full-on acting it out. It sounds a bit crazy, but it helped me feel the emotions and tweak the words to sound more natural. 
│  
│  And seriously, those epic speeches are the ones you remember, so it’s definitely worth putting in that extra effort. It’s like, just think of all the iconic speeches we see in movies. They give you chills... you know?

│  Community views on the use of AI generated imagery as a writing prompt
│  
│  Hi folks, 
│  
│  My friend and I have been experimenting with using AI generated images as the basis of story prompts.
│  
│  Someone we know will put in a random prompt (secret from us) into Midjourney, and then send us the image along with a format or style (short story, poem, noir, script). We then have a week to write that format/style using the image as inspiration. 
│  
│  So, for example, the image could be of a black and white Victorian street, and we have to write a horror short story. Or the image is a spooky Halloween setting, and we have to write a poem to suit. We then come back after a week and compare how we approached the task.
│  
│  I have found it a blast, and genuinely some of my best work. There are often elements to the image that just spark the imagination and let the ideas flow (picture is worth a thousand words). 
│  
│  However, as you may have guessed, it strays into the nebulous world of AI use in a creative context, and I totally understand and empathise with distrust. I want to make it clear that any writing itself is entirely our own work. The only AI use is in the image sent to us. Yes, we could hire an illustrator to do that, or something similar, but to me that means we are simply using someone else's creative image, not something, hopefully, somewhat random.
│  
│  I'd love to know what fellow writers think of this use-case. Is it unsettling? Do you love the idea? Are we scoundrels?
│  
│  We are worried about ever submitting some of this work to competitions, or publishing, for fear of community backlash because of the AI use. I'd feel better getting a sense of whether that is justified or not, from people who care about the craft. 
│

│  │  │  │  │  Why? If you look at a "human created" picture on the Internet and feel inspired to write a story -- what changes if you look at an "AI stolen" picture instead? (Aside from it beeing uglier.) You still have to come up with a story and write it. The picture isn't even included. As long as you have eyes, this kind of input can't be avoided, "AI" or not. There's nothing 100% pure and original. Never was.
